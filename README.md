# Animal Species Classification

## Overview
This project is an animal species classification system that categorizes animals into three classes: Mammals, Reptiles, and Birds (Aves). The classification model is built using three different deep learning architectures: ResNet, VGG16, and AlexNet. Trained with 100 images of Mammals, 100 images of Aves, and 100 images of Reptiles

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning Architectures: ResNet, VGG16, AlexNet
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- Dataset: Custom dataset containing images of Mammals, Reptiles, and Birds

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images representing three different species categories:
- Mammals
- Reptiles
- Birds (Aves)

For testing, a total of 30 images were used for evaluation.

## Model Performance
Each model was tested with 30 images, and the results are as follows:
- AlexNet: 23 correctly classified images
- VGG16: 22 correctly classified images
- ResNet: 22 correctly classified images
